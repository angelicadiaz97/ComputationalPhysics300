#Project 4: Numerical Differentiation and Applications 

The purpose of this wiki page is to introduce different approaches to compute the derivative and describe their applications to some specific problems. 
Specifically, we will be discussing the following: 
1. Finite Differences Method 
2. Complex Step Derivative
3. Cauchy Integral Formula 
 
## Definition of the Derivative 
Let's recall the definition of the derivative in terms of limits: 

$$\frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
